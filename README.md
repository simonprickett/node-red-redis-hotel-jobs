## Node-RED Flows

This repository contains two versions of the same Node-RED flow as follows:

* `flows_no_hardware.json` - use this if you're not using the optional arcade button and LED, and/or if you aren't running Node-RED on a Raspberry Pi.
* `flows_with_hardware.json` - use this if you're running on a Raspberry Pi and have fitted the optional arcade button and LED.
